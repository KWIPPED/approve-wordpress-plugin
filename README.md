# Integration Levels

## Page level tag integration

There are three types of tags that may be used on site pages. Teaser tags, action (button) tags, and "hide" tags.

### Teaser tags

Used to place dynamic teaser rates in web pages.

```html
<span approve-function="teaser_rate" approve-total="30000"></span>
```

The approve-function and approve-total properties are required. The content of the tag bearing these properties will be replaced with the official fiunancing teaser rate for the value of the approve-total property.

### Action (button) tags

```html
<button
        approve-function="hosted_app"
        approve-action="add_to_app"
        approve-model="Model-5"
        approve-price="5000"
        approve-qty="1"
        approve-item-type="new_product"
>Click here to finance a Model-5</button>

```

The approve-function, approve-action, approve-model, approve-price, approve-qty, and approve-item-type properties are required. The content of the tag bearing these properties will not be changed, but an action will be added to the element's click event. 

Note: The only approve-function available in the devtools plugin is "hosted_app" at this time.

### "Hide" tags

These tags are used to hide selected content on the page. 

```html
<approve-hide/>
```

Whe placed no the page, it will cause any other tags containing the "approve-container" property to be hidden. Example:

```html
<div approve-container>
  Lease a decontamination trailler for
  <span approve-function="teaser_rate" approve-total="300000"></span>/mo
</div>

<approve-hide/>
```

In the example above, the "approve-hide" tag will case the "div" containine the finance teaser to be hidden on the page.

## Javascript Integration

Once the devtools plugin is enabled, a kwipped_approve object is avaialble on every page in your site. The following functions are avaialble

### kwipped_approve.get_teaser(value)

Returns a promise, which will provide the teaser rate for the value provided. The following example will print the teaser rate for the value of $35,000 to the console.

```javascript
kwipped_approve.get_teaser(35000)
  .then(function(data){
  	console.log(data)
	})
  .catch(function(error){
  	console.log("An error has occurred."+error)
	});
```

### kwipped_approve.get_approve_information()

Returns an object contaning the URL for the KWIPPED hosted application page, a teaser sentence, and the raw teaser rate.

Return object example:

```javascript
{
    url: "https://example.kwipped.com&items=[{"model":"m3","quantity":"1","type":"new_product","price":"23434"},{"model":"m2","quantity":"1","type":"new_product","price":"2343"},{"model":"m3","quantity":"1","type":"new_product","price":"23434"}]",
   teaser: "Finance for $499/mo",
   teaser_raw: "499"
}
```

In order to use this tag you will have to add items to the kwipped_approve object before calling this function. 

```javascript
kwipped_approve.add_item(model,price,qty,item_type);
```

Example:

```javascript
kwipped_approve.add_item("Model-3",10000,1,"new_product");
```

After adding at least one item, the kwipped_approve.get_approve_information() function will return the correct information for the value provided. The following utilitarian functions are also available:

```javascript
kwipped_approve.get_current_items()
//Returns the list of current items.
kwipped_approve.remove_item(index) 
//Removes item at the provided index
kwipped_approve.clear_items()
//Removes all items currently in the list
```

## PHP code

The same constructs avaialble in javascript are avaialble as PHP functions for sever side processing needs. 

### Approve library instantiation

```php 
use \com\kwipped\approve\wordpress\devtools\Approve;
$app = new Approve();
```

### Adding items and retrieving approve information

After instantiating the Approve class, add items to it in the following fashion.

```php
$app->add($model,$price,$qty,$item_type);
```

Retrieve APPROVE information using the following method:
```php
$app->get_approve_information()
```

Example:
```php
$app->add("Model-1","1000","3","new_product");
$app->add("Model-2","2000","1","new_product");
//Print the returned information to the page.
echo "<pre>";
echo print_r($app->get_approve_information());
echo "</pre>";
```

### Teaser rates
Teaser rates will be dynamically generated by using the following function:
```php
$app->get_teaser($approve_total));
```
Example:
```php
echo "<pre>";
echo print_r($app->get_teaser(25000));
echo "</pre>";
```
